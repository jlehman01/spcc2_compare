## Input Data

The following POIs were queried from Open Street Map:

-   Town Hall
-   Post Office
-   Police
-   Fire Station
-   Courthouse
-   Library
-   Government

## Analysis

500-foot grid cells were created. The number of unique POI categories within 1,000 feet from the center of each cell was calculated, returning a value of 0-7 for each cell, with 7 representing all POI types are present, and 0 representing no POIs present.

### Map of Results

*Note: you may need to zoom in to see grid cells.*

```{r}


tm_shape(grid_with_summary) + tm_fill(col = "count", palette = "-inferno") +
  tm_shape(merged_points) + tm_dots(col = "type", 
                                  border.lwd = 0,
                                  palette = "viridis")

```
