## Summary

The purpose of this page is to review the method and process for acquiring and summarizing service-oriented POIs in the D4 region.

## Input Data

The following POIs were queried from Open Street Map:

-   Town Hall
-   Post Office
-   Police
-   Fire Station
-   Courthouse
-   Government

The following POIs were obtained from FGDL:

-   Library
-   Theaters & Performing Arts Center
-   Museums & Art Galleries

The following model SE data is used to filter POI clusters:

-   TCRPM5 and SERPM8 zones with employment density greater than 20 jobs / acre.

## Analysis

500-foot grid cells were created. The number of unique POI categories within 1,000 feet from the center of each cell was calculated, returning a value of 0-7 for each cell, with 7 representing all POI category types are present, and 0 representing no POI category types are present.

Finally, these areas are mapped with zones that contain the C5 employment threshold or greater of at least 20 jobs per acre.
